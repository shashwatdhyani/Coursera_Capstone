Problem Description :

Build the Machine Learning Model (ML) to predict the Accident Severity  on the basis of the several parameters such as Weather conditions , Road conditions, Light conditions , Location , junction type and the vehicles over-speeding or not.
If the accident happen it creates traffic chaos which become difficult to manage. Victims need to be transported to the nearby hospital and the colliding vehicle need to be cleared to make way for the traffic.
This puts additional pressure on the Seattle Police and Traffic department and causes unnecessary delay to the people driving to the work or other city.
This model needs to be build while holding regular discussions with the Seattle Police and Traffic Department since they are the stakeholders and stand to benefit from this model.
Once the Model has been build and deployed , it can be used by the Seattle Police and Traffic Department to warn the People driving on such conditions so that People can drive more safely or even change their travel plans.
This model will not only help people to avoid getting into the accidents but it will also help Seattle Traffic and Police Department to avoid traffic chaos which could result due to such accidents.
